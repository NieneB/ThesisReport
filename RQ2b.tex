\section{Method RQ 2B - Collection geodata of rollator movements and analysis}
The data collection and pre-processing per sensor used in this research will be explained in the next sections per sensor. The different sensors make use of different time zones or geographic systems, therefore some general pre-processing steps had to be conducted to standardize all the files in order to compare them in the end. 

\subsection{Data Collection - Accelerometer}
We used a Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8260 smart phone which was available at the conducting faculty. With the application; Accelerometer Physics toolbox accelerometer to extract the 3-axis acceleration data on the X, Y and Z axis and the total acceleration called g-force. Physics Toolbox Accelerometer proved to be the best option for extracting the data, for it is easy to use, can store the data in a csv file, with current clock time, time stamp and saves it on the local storage of the phone. It does not require a constant internet connection, and was free for use. Also no knowledge on any pre-programming to read the sensors was required.

Some of the other application alternatives considered are: Accelerometer Monitor from Mobile Tools, Accelerometer Monitor from Keuwlsoft Tools, and the AcMeter. Their specifications and reasons why not used, can be found in Annex \ref{Aapps}. 

\subsubsection{Application version change}
Several versions of the application were used, as the developer updated the app meanwhile. \footnote{Information provided by Chrystian Vieyra, developer of the Physics Toolbox Applications. In e-mail conversation 26-10-15. }
In September 2015 version 1.2.9 was active. On September 9th the version available was 1.3.6. Though, the smart phones used, were not always attached to the internet, and so version 1.29. was used in the beginning. This resulted into failed experiments for there was no wake lock, which keeps the device awake even if the screen turns off while the record button has been pressed. So the app was put to sleep during the measurements. Test rides on a bike were conducted but the gaps of missing data seemed to happen when large bumps occurred in the road and the conducting researcher kept the screen awake more often by touching the smart-phone more often. 

Later measurements were taken with version 1.3.6 and 1.3.7, which did continue the app measuring when the screen was in sleep mode. The only difference between version 1.3.6 and 1.3.7 is a spelling mistake and the graphic layout of the record button.

\subsection{Data Pre-processing - Accelerometer}
The accelerometer contains the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time zone: CET. Same as the smart phone settings. 
\item CSV time stamp: clock time in milliseconds
\item No location
\end{itemize}

Accelerometer output ranged between the normalized range of -2 to 2. Assumed is that the value of 1 means equal to 1 times the gravitational force: 9.81 $m/s^2$ and the value of 0 means no force pulling, so the sensor is flat. The developer stated, that these normalized values differ per type of smart phone.\footnote{Information provided by Chrystian Vieyra, developer of the Physics Toolbox Applications. In e-mail conversation 26-10-15. }

The application contained several settings, which were not described in the application nor on-line. Therefore some sample test were conducted to gain some basic information about the application values and settings. The application had four record interval settings, Normal, UI, Game and Fast. By placing the phone for a while on the table with the different settings the following information was found about the sample frequency of these settings: 

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\renewcommand{\tabcolsep}{0.2cm}
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Sample frequency of the different settings.}
\label{samfreq}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2.5cm}|} 
\hline 
 Setting & Points per sec(exact) & Points per sec (approx.) & Periodicity (1/(points per sec))\\
\hline
NORMAL & 4.6 & 5 &  0.2 \\
UI & 11.9 & 10 & 0.1 \\
GAME & 49.6 & 50 &  0.02 \\
FAST & 99.4 & 100 &  0.01 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This means that with an average walking speed of 1.3$m/s$ the distance between the measured points will be, 26$cm$ for NORMAL sample frequency, 13$cm$ for UI, 2.6$cm$ for GAME and 1.3$cm$ for FAST sample frequency. 
For further calculations the setting NORMAL is used. This because an interval of 26 cm seams sufficient and the data set will be not too large in size to handle. 

Because the accelerometer sensor is not calibrated and the quality is unknown, it can contain random errors (caused by the accuracy limit of the measuring instrument) or systemic error (caused by incorrect calibration of the measuring instrument). 
By placing the smart phone flat on a table, laying still for several hours, an indication can be given of the sensors offset. This means the z-axis is pointing down and also contains one time the gravitational force pulling it down. Resulting in numbers around 1. The x and y axis are pointing to the side and front/back. Being flat and resulting in numbers around 0.

The following sensor errors were found with setting NORMAL for every axis:

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\renewcommand{\tabcolsep}{0.2cm}
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Average error per axis. Sample frequency 5 per sec (NORMAL)}
\label{averageerror}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|} 
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{SAM 3} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{SAM 4} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{SAM 5} \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Average error from 0} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Average error from 0} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Average error from 0} \\ 
\hline
$\xi_{x}$ & -0.04 &$\xi_{x}$ & -0.05 &$\xi_{x}$ & -0.03 \\
$\xi_{y}$ & 0.03 & $\xi_{y}$ & 0.06 & $\xi_{y}$ & 0.05 \\
$\xi_{z}$ & 1.01 & $\xi_{z}$ & 1.02 & $\xi_{z}$ & 1.03 \\
$\xi_{m}$ & 1.02 & $\xi_{m}$ & 1.02 & $\xi_{m}$ & 1.03 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These average errors $\xi_{x}$ , $\xi_{y}$, $\xi_{z}$ and $\xi_{m}$ are extracted from all measured Accelerometer time series per smart phone. 

The total acceleration or g-force is supplied by the application: It is the total acceleration vector of the 3 axis combined. The calculated $A_{m}$ is equal to the g-force provided by the application. It will be referred to as $A_{m}$ or total acceleration, for G-force can be a confusing concept. $A_{m}$ is a representative parameter which includes the gait acceleration (Y-axis), the vertical acceleration (Z-axis) and the lateral acceleration (X-axis). ~\cite{Weiss2014}
This can be calculated by:

\begin{equation}
A_{m} = \sqrt {{A_{x}}^{2} + {A_{y}}^{2} + {A_{z}}^ {2}}
\end{equation} For each time series $A_{i}$ , with $i = {x, y, z}$ 



\subsection{Data Collection - GPS }
Several sensors were used for measuring GPS, varying in its details and specifications. The reason several ways to measure location were used is because not all the devices were available all the time. 

\begin{description} 
\item[Garmin Summit]
For the rollator loop the Garmin Summit was used with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time zone: UTM
\item Projected Coordinate System: WGS84
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[GPS Geotracker ]
On the smart phone the application GPS Geotracker was used. Version: 3.0.3 from 23 July 2015 Author: Ilya Bogdanovisch. This resulted in the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time zone: UTM
\item Projected Coordinate System: WGS84
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[Leica GNSS RTK]
For more precise location measurements the Leica system was attached to the Measurement Rollator. Though, only one Leica system was available and it was to heavy to attach to an elderly's rollator. The following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time zone: UTM
\item Projected Coordinate System: WGS84
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

The Leica is much more precise then the Garmin or the GPS tracker on the smart phone. But when the Leica was not available, the other two methods still gave a good reference as were the route was. 

\subsection{Data Pre-processing - GPS }

Pre-processing steps for all gps points:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Import GPX file into Arc-map, creating Point features. 
\item Transform from WGS1984 to RD new (if necessary)
\item Necessary time editing attribute so all in format YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.OOO and transform to time zone CET.
\item Using Track analyst for computing difference in time and speed between the points. Settings:
\begin{itemize}
 \item First to second point
 \item Meters, Seconds, Meter per seconds and Degrees
\end{itemize}
\item Manually editing the start and end points. To exclude the waiting time before the actual walking, and the waiting at the end to turn the devices off. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Collection - Movie material}
Most walks were recorded on film, for reference aid. This was done with either a go-pro, flip camera or with the smart phone camera. Pointed at the direct surface in front of the rollator. The images are not used for calculations, solely for reference backup. 


\subsection{Analysis - Mapping irregular surfaces with an Accelerometer}
\begin{description}
\item[Hypotheses 1] : Vibrations of the Rollator increase while walking on surfaces with more hindrance. 
\item[Hypothesis 2] : The vibrations caused by the hindrance can be measured with the variance in the z-axis acceleration. 
\end{description}

Several test were conducted with the Measurement Rollator on different surfaces. Used the Accelerometer (Physics Toolbox version 1.3.7) and the Garmin to record GPS. The goal was to walk with an average walking speed of $4.7 km/h (3.2 â€“ 6.2 km/h)$. This is the walking speed found from literature and own research. Though, while walking it felt quite fast. So the walking speed was kept around 4 km/h as best as possible. The researcher walked herself with the rollator over different surfaces. Each a distance of around $20m$. 

\subsubsection{Set-up}
The smart phone will always be placed horizontally on the Rollator. This means the $z$-axis is pointing down, and will correlate most with movements up and down. The x-axis will be pointing sideways and the y-axis front and back. Acceleration of walking speed will be seen in the $y$-axis. While turns will be seen in the $x$-axis. See figure ~\ref{setup} and ~\ref{setup2}

\end{figure}

All the pavement surfaces structures shown in image ~\ref{surfaceimg} were tested. Asphalt or tarmac, brick paving, tiles, gravel and grass. Also a smooth concrete surface inside was measured.

\subsubsection{Statistics}
By providing the descriptive statistics of the accelerometer output as a normal distribution, the differences in the vibrations on different surfaces can be explained. The data is approaching a normal distribution as can be seen in the example histogram or tarmac.(~\ref{hist})
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/M_hist_tarmac_old.pdf}

\caption{Histogram of tarmac surface $z$-axis acceleration \label{hist}}
\end{figure}

Vibration goes into both directions so the mean will not show a surface specific outcome and will not differ much between the different surfaces. The means calculated only gave values around the 1. See table~\ref{stathindrance}.
% 4.3 statistic summary surface hindrance in results

The variability shows better how rough the surface is. Therefore the variability is used, or the standard deviation together with the 5-number summary to create box plots. Including, the minimum, maximum, median and first and third quantile. To show a better understanding of the effect of the surface on the vibrations on the rollator. The formula for the mean variance and standard deviation:

\textbf{Mean:}  
\begin{equation}
Mean A_{z} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n A_{z}}{n}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Variance:}
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n (A_{z}- mean(A_{z}))^2}{n-1}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Standard deviation:}
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sqrt \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n (A_{z}- mean(A_{z}))^2}{n-1}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Comparison with Matthews et al. (2003)}
In Matthews et al. (2003)~\cite{Matthews2003} a reference score for hindrance of specific surfaces is provided. Shown in table~\ref{hindrance}. These values will be used as a reference, to see if the measured vibrations of the Accelerometer correlate. Because the reference numbers are relative, also the measured outcome is recalculated to a relative factor. Taking the most smooth surface as factor 1 and calculating the rest of the surfaces from this. See results in figure~\ref{comparefig} for a comparison of the values of Matthews and the calculated factors.
