When correlation $A_{m}$ with $A_{x}$, $A_{y}$ and $A_{z}$. The z-acceleration best describes the overall acceleration. For the set-up used in these experiments.  With an average correlation of 0.8.




The sum mean Acceleration can be calculated by:  %%%% Gebruik ik dit wel? 
\begin{equation}
A_{SMA} = A_{x} + A_{y} + A_{z}
\end{equation}
For every $A_{i}$ , with $i = {x, y, z}$.

The variance change points in the z-axis will show the change in hindrance or detect sudden obstacles. The variance change in the x-axis will show curves. 
The variance change points in the y-ax will show sudden increase or decrease of speed.
