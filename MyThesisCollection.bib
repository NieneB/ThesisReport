abstract = {a b s t r a c t Increasing attention is being paid to the importance of built environment characteristics for participa-tion, especially among people with various levels of impairment or activity limitations. The purpose of this research was to examine the role of specific characteristics in the urban environment as they interact with underlying impairments and activity limitations to either promote or hinder participation in life situations. Using data from the Chicago Community Adult Health Study (2001e2003) in the United States, we used logistic regression to examine the effect of built environment characteristics on three indicators of participation (interpersonal interaction, obtaining preventive health care, and voting) among adults age 45þ (N ¼ 1225). We examined effects across two levels of spatial scale: the census tract and block group. One in five adults reported difficulty walking 2e3 blocks unaided, but their odds of engaging in regular interpersonal interaction was 45\% higher when they lived in areas with higher residential security. For the thirty-six percent of adults who reported visual impairment, and the odds of obtaining preventive health care were over 20\% lower when living in an area with heavy traffic. Residing in an area with a high proportion of streets in poor condition was associated with 60\% lower odds of voting among those with underlying difficulty with mobility activities. Results varied across levels of spatial scale. Simple changes in urban built environments may facilitate the full participation of all persons in society.},

abstract = {Volgens de nieuwe bevolkingsprognose van het CBS groeit de Nederlandse bevolking nog door tot 18 miljoen inwoners rond 2044, waarna de groei sterk vertraagt. Internationale migratie speelt een belangrijke rol bij de toekomstige bevolkingsgroei. Nederland telt in de toekomst meer ouderen en allochtonen. Ten opzichte van de bevolkingsprognose uit 2012 zijn de veronderstellingen voor het kindertal en de levensduur vrijwel ongewijzigd. Wel worden er meer immigranten en meer emigranten verwacht. De verwachte bevolkingsomvang in 2060 is 0,16 miljoen groter dan volgens de prognose uit 2012. Dat verschil zit geheel bij de inwoners jonger dan 65 jaar. Net als in de prognose uit 2012 wordt voorzien dat de AOW-leeftijd verder stijgt tot 71,5 jaar in 2060. 1. Inleiding De bevolkingsprognose van het CBS beschrijft de verwachte ontwikkeling van de Nederlandse bevolking tot 2060, waarbij de inwoners worden onderscheiden naar leeftijd, geslacht en herkomstgroep. Ook geeft de prognose informatie over geboorte, sterfte en internationale migratie. In deze nieuwe bevolkingsprognose zijn de recente ontwikkelingen op het gebied van kindertal, levensduur en migratie verwerkt. In het licht van deze ontwikkelingen zijn ook de in de vorige prognose (2012–2060) gebruikte langetermijnveronderstellingen opnieuw beoordeeld. Op het gebied van kindertal en levensduur heeft dat niet tot aanpassingen geleid, op het gebied van internationale migratie wel. Dit artikel beschrijft de uitkomsten van de bevolkingsprognose 2014–2060. Paragraaf 2 geeft een kort overzicht van de voorziene veranderingen in de omvang en samenstelling van de bevolking aan de hand van drie steekjaren (2015, 2040 en 2060). In paragraaf 3 worden de onderliggende veronderstellingen van de prognose toegelicht: Hoeveel kinderen krijgen vrouwen? Hoe oud worden we? Hoeveel migranten komen naar Nederland en welk deel blijft? De verschillen met de prognose uit 2012 worden besproken. Paragraaf 4 beschrijft de verwachte ontwikkeling van de bevolkingsstromen: geboorte, sterfte en migratie. Paragraaf 5 gaat dieper in op de veranderende leeftijdssamenstelling van de bevolking. In paragraaf 6 komt de toekomstige ontwikkeling van de AOW-leeftijd aan de orde, en welke consequenties die heeft voor het aantal inwoners in de werkzame leeftijden en het aantal AOW-gerechtigden.},

We evaluated the validity of Walk Score ® for assessing neighborhood walkability based on GIS (objective) indicators of neighborhood walkability with addresses from four US metropolitan areas with several street network buffer distances (i.e., 400-, 800-, and 1,600-meters). Address data come from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5–11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programs located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the US (n = 733). GIS data were used to measure multiple objective indicators of neighborhood walkability. Walk Scores were also obtained for the participant's residential addresses. Spearman correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators were calculated as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. There were many significant moderate correlations OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2011, 8 4161 between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators such as density of retail destinations and intersection density (p < 0.05). The magnitude varied by the GIS indicator of neighborhood walkability. Correlations generally became stronger with a larger spatial scale, and there were some geographic differences. Walk Score ® is free and publicly available for public health researchers and practitioners. Results from our study suggest that Walk Score ® is a valid measure of estimating certain aspects of neighborhood walkability, particularly at the 1600-meter buffer. As such, our study confirms and extends the generalizability of previous findings demonstrating that Walk Score is a valid measure of estimating neighborhood walkability in multiple geographic locations and at multiple spatial scales.},

The immediate purpose of this study is to arm researchers with operational definitions they can use to measure the street environment and test for significant associations with walking behaviour.

It is based on a review of the literature, and the initial analyses of the first stage of a study designed to identify individual's views of the quality of their lives and to test the relevance of various scales used to measure quality of life. The study focuses on older people living at home in two contrasting areas of south east England, and demonstrates not only that older people can talk about, and do think about, quality of life, but also highlights how quality of life varies for different age groups of the elderly population living at home, in different geographical areas. In addition, early conclusions also indicate that there is more to quality of life than health: indeed, social contacts appear to be as valued components of a good quality of life as health status. This study deals with issues high on the agenda of the current debate on quality of life and its measurement; it has implications for those involved in both quality of life research and in health and social service policy for older people.},

Surges of interest in systematic specialties and technical innovations in representation and analysis have changed the nature of geographic knowledge, advanced geographic vocabulary, defined and examined geographic concepts, and developed spatially explicit theories relat-ing to human and physical environments. Explorations of interactions between these domains has generated a new interest in integrated science. This interest has produced a unique way of examining human-environment relations, and has provided the basis for a vastly different underlying knowledge structure in the discipline.

De extramuralisering en het toenemende aantal ouderen vragen o.a. om wijken waarin mensen met een beperking zelfstandig kunnen blijven wonen. Wijken waarin bewoners zorg en begrip voor hun medemensen hebben. Wijken die sociaal en fysiek toegankelijk zijn voor iedereen. Als ik naar de wijken en buurten in Amsterdam kijk denk ik dat er nog veel te winnen valt voor mensen met een beperking en dat er weinig wijken zijn die aan de boven gestelde eisen voldoen. Ik werk als procesbegeleider voor bewonersgroepen in verschillende vernieuwingswijken in Amsterdam en hou mij vooral bezig met de fysieke kant. Ik zie dat het nog niet vanzelfsprekend is dat professionals van de overheid, projectontwikkelaars, ontwerpers en belangenorganisaties rond wonen ervan doordrongen zijn dat we toe moeten werken naar wijken voor iedereen. De wettelijke regelingen en verordeningen rond toegankelijkheid zijn vaak de enige eisen die toegepast worden en we weten dat deze lang niet voldoende zijn. Kortom ik denk dat we als professionals en medemensen verplicht zijn de komende jaren veel aandacht aan de ontwikkeling van wijken voor iedereen te geven. Door het uitvoeren van dit onderzoek ben ikzelf ervan doordrongen geraakt mij in mijn dagelijks werk in te zetten voor wijken voor iedereen. Ik kan mij dankzij het onderzoek verplaatsen in het perspectief van mensen met een beperking en probeer in mijn dagelijkse werk hiermee rekening te houden. Ook zal ik meer attent zijn op mijn gedrag in de openbare ruimte door bijvoorbeeld erover nadenken waar ik mijn fiets parkeer \ldots Ik hoop dat dit rapport een bijdrage kan leveren aan de discussie over het belang van wijken voor iedereen en dat hierdoor nog meer mensen doordrongen raken van het belang van wijken voor iedereen.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t In countries with winter weather characterised by low temperatures, snowfall and icy roads and pave-ments, getting out of the home to carry out everyday activities can be a challenge for many older people in cities and beyond. Inadequate clearance of snow and poor gritting of pavements prevent people with even slightly reduced motion capacity from going outdoors, while those who use a walking-stick or a roll-ing walker are even more vulnerable to the weather. How much does winter weather impact on the activ-ity levels of older people, and what activities are affected? The empirical analysis in this paper is based on results from focus groups of participants carried out in five different communities in Norway and on data from the Norwegian National Travel Survey (NTS) of 2005. The study is concentrated on the daily activ-ities of the groups, especially out-of-home activities, i.e. what these older people do, where their activities take place, with whom they interact, the types of transport mode they use, and the barriers they meet. Winter conditions are mentioned by all groups as one of the barriers they have to contend with. The NTS includes data on transport mode, travel purpose, distance, time-use, date for the interview and socio-demographic data. The results point to lower activity \`{A} measured in number of trips taken and kilometres travelled in winter (November–March) compared to summer (April–October) among the older groups. The oldest use the car less in the winter than in the summer, and have fewer trips to the shops and to friends and relatives.},

In order to explore differences according to functional limitations (FL) among very old people with respect to frequency of activity, perceived health, overall perception of neighbourhood environment, and perceived problems in the pedestrian environment, data derived from a postal questionnaire survey to very old people living in an urban area in Sweden were used. This explorative study is based on the sub-sample of people aged 80+ who reported outdoor activities (n = 97). Four groups of respondents with different types of FL were identified: with no FL (n = 23), with only move-ment-related FL (n = 26), with only perception/cognition-related FL (n = 16), and with both movement-and per-ception/ cognition-related FL (n = 32). The majority of the respondents reported rather high frequency of activity out-side home. When examining differences between the four groups, the analysis indicated how the complexity of FL and perceived problems in the pedestrian environment impacted on their activity performance. Persons with both movement-and perception/cognition-related FL were less satisfied with their frequency of activity, experienced their health more negatively and experienced more problems in the pedestrian environment than in the other groups. The findings from this study indicate the importance of considering combinations of FL in creating supportive environments for activity and health.},

Data of 1634 people aged 55 years and older were available for analyses (response 64\%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine possible associations between expressed information needs and variables on demographics, lifestyle risk behaviours, physical and psychosocial health. Results: Several significant associations were found between information needs and corre-sponding health and lifestyle problems. However, the explanatory power of the observed problems was generally low, explaining only 7\% of the informational needs on lifestyle, and 17\% and 28\% of the informational needs on physical and psychosocial health, respectively. Conclusions: The findings suggest that prevention amongst the elderly should not be solely based on information needs, but also on observed lifestyle and health. Implications for the use of different approaches of prevention and behavioural models underlying interventions are discussed.},

abstract = {Travel encompasses a much wider environment than a journey by a person in a vehicle, thus actual travel takes place within the 'travel environment'. Travel is very complex but it can be subdivided into three broad components: the person; the vehicle; and the built environment. Travel can only be carried out if the three components are linked by means of a 'travel chain' and a journey cannot be made effectively if all the links are not efficiently joined. For many mobility-impaired people the 'travel chain' is negated by 'built environment barriers'. Travel is interdisciplinary and only an interdisciplinary approach can reduce barriers and increase mobility. Thus this paper is interdisciplinary in its approach to a major transport problem -the 'unfriendly street'. Accessible buses are starting to come into operation in the United Kingdom and expectations are high that the travel of older people will increase because of these buses. The authors use recent research to challenge this belief and argue that there will be little increase in travel by older people owing to present low patronage and built environment barriers. The authors then identify major barriers to travel which make streets very unfriendly and itemize 18 barriers to access which can be removed by good design. Design parameters are presented to overcome the major problem of unfriendly surfaces in paved areas and the paper concludes by reiterating that travel for older people can only be increased by an interdiscipline approach which links 'friendly buses' with 'friendly streets'.},

This paper presents one innovative technique that utilizes GIS to organize and analyze data taken from focus groups and the self-mapping of individual space. Implications for transportation planning include redefining how networks are conceived to include not just road and bus networks, but also the spatio-temporal networks constructed by low-income people as they organize their activities.-tion Research Board 2005). For women who do not have access to a private vehicle, there are the added constraints of using public transportation; which often entails limited routes, inconvenient transfers, long travel times, and safety issues. These constraints are even more pronounced in low-income households, which tend to make fewer trips and travel shorter distances (Bingham and Zhang 1997; Lucas 2004). This lack of access to adequate mobility has led some researchers to explore the relationship between transport and social exclusion (Keyton et al.},

Gemeenten zoeken het antwoord vooral in meer vrijwilligerswerk en mantelzorg en het geschikt maken ('opplussen') van woningen voor ouderen. MENSenSTRAAT stelt dat ook de woonomgeving een doorslaggevende rol speelt in het welslagen van deze missie. Zolang ouderen zelfstandig de deur uit kunnen en durven, kunnen zij voldoende bewegen, zelf hun boodschappen doen en hun sociale contacten onderhouden en daarmee de regie houden over hun leven. Om dit mogelijk te maken, moet de woonomgeving worden aangepast aan de kleine actieradius en de kwetsbaarheid van ouderen. In het verlengde van het opplussen van woningen, pleit MENSenSTRAAT voor het opplussen van straten en buurten.},

abstract = {Walking is one of the most common of all human movements. It exists to transport the body safely and efficiently across ground level, uphill or downhill. Walking is learned during the first year of life and reaches maturity around 7 until 60 years. Elderly walking performance then starts to decline and the elderly slow down gradually. Falls are a major cause of morbidity in the elderly and in almost all incidences of falls, some aspects of locomotion have been implicated. With the increased life expectancy of the elderly and their more active lifestyle there is now an emphasis on determining any changes that occur in their gait patterns in order to reduce the frequency of falls, to identify diagnostic measures that are reliable predictors of fall-prone elderly and finally to develop programs for preventing such falls. This review addresses the gait related changes in the elderly in order to pinpoint the effect of normal aging for comparison with different gait deviations related to some pathologies. Spatio-temporal, kinematics, kinetics and EMG data will be reviewed as well as the physiological changes associated with gait and aging. Finally, the selection criteria will be reviewed and recommendation on the urgent need of a valid healthy elderly database will be addressed. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The effect of built environment on mobility in older populations, among whom environmental effects may be strongest, is the focus of a growing body of the literature. We reviewed recent research (1990–2010) that examined associations of objective measures of the built environment with mobility and disability in adults aged 60 years or older. Seventeen empirical articles were identified. The existing literature suggests that mobility is associated with higher street connectivity leading to shorter pedestrian distances, street and traffic conditions such as safety measures, and proximity to destinations such as retail establishments, parks, and green spaces. Existing research is limited by differences in exposure and outcome assessments and use of cross-sectional study designs. This research could lead to policy interventions that allow older adults to live more healthy and active lives in their communities.},

abstract = {The paper provides a first investigation of the suitability of different measures of activity space size to identify persons at risk of social exclusion. This would be a new departure for the measurement of social exclusion, which so far has relied either on aggregate measures of locations or cross-sectional data of individuals. The size of a person's activity space can only be estimated with information reflecting a longer time horizon. In this paper the six-week travel diary survey (Mobidrive) is used, which was conducted in two German cities in 1999. About 95\% of all local trips were coded for 300 respondents (about 45,000 trips). The paper develops three possible measurement approaches of increasing complexity (confidence ellipse, kernel density estimates, shortest paths networks). The analysis revealed that the main driver of the size of the activity spaces is the overall number of unique locations visited by the respondents and to a lesser extent, their socio-demographic characteristics. In particular, the groups most often consider to be at risk of social exclusion (female, lower income, elderly) did not show significantly different activity spaces.},

@article{Sherman2005,
abstract = {Background: "Activity space" has been used to examine how people's habitual movements interact with their environment, and can be used to examine accessibility to healthcare opportunities. Traditionally, the standard deviational ellipse (SDE), a Euclidean measure, has been used to represent activity space. We describe the construction and application of the SDE at one and two standard deviations, and three additional network-based measures of activity space using common tools in GIS: the road network buffer (RNB), the 30-minute standard travel time polygon (STT), and the relative travel time polygon (RTT). We compare the theoretical and methodological assumptions of each measure, and evaluate the measures by examining access to primary care services, using data from western North Carolina. Results: Individual accessibility is defined as the availability of healthcare opportunities within that individual's activity space. Access is influenced by the shape and area of an individual's activity space, the spatial distribution of opportunities, and by the spatial structures that constrain and direct movement through space; the shape and area of the activity space is partly a product of how it is conceptualized and measured. Network-derived measures improve upon the SDE by incorporating the spatial structures (roads) that channel movement. The area of the STT is primarily influenced by the location of a respondent's residence within the road network hierarchy, with residents living near primary roads having the largest activity spaces. The RNB was most descriptive of actual opportunities and can be used to examine bypassing. The area of the RTT had the strongest correlation with a healthcare destination being located inside the activity space. Conclusion: The availability of geospatial technologies and data create multiple options for representing and operationalizing the construct of activity space. Each approach has its strengths and limitations, and presents a different view of accessibility. While the choice of method ultimately lies in the research question, interpretation of results must consider the interrelated issues of method, representation, and application. Triangulation aids this interpretation and provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of accessibility.},

This paper examines effects of removing physical barriers according to current Swedish governmental accessibility directives on older peoples' perceptions of outdoor environments (usability) and on their mobility and perceived safety as pedestrians. This paper also focuses on municipal planners' views on the implementation of improved accessibility. A before–after study, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, is conducted. The results from the questionnaires show that older peoples' overall satisfaction with the outdoor environment has increased after implementation; however no differences are found if physical barriers specifically are considered. Older peoples' mobility is also unchanged; nevertheless, fewer respondents are stating difficulties in walking due to barriers in the outdoor environments as reason to avoid outdoor mobility. Problems do remain after implementation, for example concerning safety/security-related issues and inaccessible entrances and indoor environments.},

abstract = {The aim of the present Country Report is to present a comprehensive and true generic picture of the pedestrian's functioning and satisfaction with offered conditions. In order to provide a true picture of reality, hidden issues must be uncovered, and figures be corrected for bias, by complementary estimations. Furthermore, reality must be evaluated from all relevant perspectives: functionality, perception, durability and future prospects, and coherence and integration. A decisive factor in pedestrian performance and satisfaction is the pedestrian's ability to cope with his environment. Pedestrians are an extremely heterogeneous group. The functioning of the system depends particularly on how well low competency persons can function. The order of magnitude of mobility restrictions can be estimated through much used indicators from the SF12 surveys and OECD indicators for Quality of Life studies. Additional indicators can be derived from travel surveys and health statistics on disorders. About 50\% of the pedestrians have limited abilities and about 10\% of the population has severe difficulties walking and sojourning in public space (see tables 2 – 12) Mobility is defined by the freedom to choose to travel and sojourn in public space. The amount of distance that one can cover is less important than being able to make a trip. Pedestrian mobility differs from other modes by that it is part of almost all other trips. Multi-modal walking is (almost) as extensive as walking from door to door, but this is hidden in statistics. However, the hidden amount of walking can be estimated within reasonable margins.},

We have considered existing visualization-based techniques for exploratory analysis of spatio-temporal data from two perspectives: (1) what types of spatio-temporal data they are applicable to; (2) what exploratory tasks they can potentially support. The technique investigation has been based on an operational typology of spatio-temporal data and analytical tasks we specially devised for this purpose. The result of the study is a structured inventory of existing exploratory techniques related to the types of data and tasks they are appropriate for. This result is potentially helpful for data analysts - users of geovisualization tools: it provides guidelines for selection of proper exploratory techniques depending on the characteristics of data to analyze and the goals of analysis. At the same time the inventory as well as the suggested typology of tasks could be useful for tool designers and developers of various domain-specific geovisualization applications. The designers can, on the one hand, see what task types are insufficiently supported by the existing tools and direct their creative activities towards filling the gaps, on the other hand, use the techniques described as basic elements for building new, more sophisticated ones. The application developers can, on the one hand, use the task and data typology in the analysis of potential user needs, on the other hand, appropriately select and combine existing tools in order to satisfy these needs. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

With respect to spatial resolution, data should be available down to the level of single streets or even specific properties.

This raises a couple of questions which are also relevant in a broader context, namely the ontological representation of and reasoning about geographic places.

abstract = {Safeguarding and exploiting Cultural Heritage induce the production of numerous and heterogeneous data. The management of these data is an essential task for the use and the diffusion of the information gathered on the field. Previously, the data handling was a hand-made task done thanks to efficient and experienced methods. Until the growth of computer science, other methods have been carried out for the digital preservation and treatment of Cultural Heritage information. The development of computerized data management systems to store and make use of archaeological datasets is then a significant task nowadays. Especially for sites that have been excavated and worked without computerized means, it is now necessary to put all the data produced onto computer. This allows preservation of the information digitally (in addition with the paper documents) and offers new exploitation possibilities, like the immediate connection of different kinds of data for analyses, or the digital documentation of the site for its improvement. Geographical Information Systems have proved their potentialities in this scope, but they are not always adapted to the management of features at the scale of a particular archaeological site. Therefore this paper aims to present the development of a Virtual Research Environment dedicated to the exploitation of intra-site Cultural Heritage data. The Information System produced is based on open-source software modules dedicated to the Internet, so users can avoid being software driven and can register and consult data from different computers. The system gives the opportunity to do exploratory analyses of the data, especially at spatial and temporal levels. The system is compliant to every kind of Cultural Heritage site and allows management of diverse types of data. Some experimentation has been done on sites managed by the Service of the National Sites and Monuments of Luxembourg. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

In both arenas, visualization and visual methods are central. I show how methodologies drawn from quantitative and qualitative approaches to geovisualization in GIScience offer productive ways of working with geoweb-based information in research, and examine recent efforts to use critical visual methods to study the geoweb as visual practice.},

We then propose design principles for creating effective transitions and illustrate the application of these principles in DynaVis, a visualization system featuring animated data graphics. Two controlled experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of various transition types, finding that animated transitions can significantly improve graphical perception.},

The discussion focuses on the relationship between multi-dimensional data sets and applications, as well as the thick/thin client and heavy/light server structure. Two models of data sets are addressed in this paper. One is the use of traditional 3-D data format such as 3-D Studio Max, Open Inventor 2.0, Vis5D and OBJ. The other is modelled by a web-based language such as VRML. Also, traditional languages such as C and C+ +, as well as web-based programming tools such as Java, Java3D and ActiveX, can be used for developing applications. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are elaborated. Four practical solutions for using VRML and Java, Java and Java3D, VRML and ActiveX and Java wrapper classes (Java and C/C+ +), to develop applications are presented for web-based, real-time interactive and explorative visualization.},

abstract = {New spatial media – the informational artefacts and mediating technologies of the geoweb – represent new opportunities for activist, civic, grassroots, indigenous and other groups to leverage web-based geographic infor- mation technologies in their efforts to effect social change. Drawing upon evidence from an inductive analysis of five online initiatives that engage new spatial media in activism and civic engagement, we explore new dimensions of the knowledge politics advanced through new spatial media and the mechanisms through which they emerge. ‘Knowledge politics’ refers to the use of particular information content, forms of representation or ways of analysing and manipulating information to try to establish the authority or legitimacy of knowledge claims. The five new spatial media initiatives we analyse here introduce new dimensions to the modes of col- lecting, validating and representing information, when considered against practices of many activist ⁄ civic encounters with other kinds of geographic information technologies, such as GIS. The significance of these practices is not in their (arguable) newness, but rather their role in advancing different epistemological strate- gies for establishing the legitimacy and authority of knowledge claims. Specifically, these new knowledge politics entail a deployment of geovisual artefacts to structure a visual experience; a prioritisation of individualised interactive ⁄ exploratory ways of knowing; hyper-granular, highly immediate, experiential cartographic represen- tations de-coupled from conventional practices of cartographic abstraction; and approaches to asserting credi- bility through witnessing, peer verification and transparency.

This new storage framework promises better scalability with rapidly growing datasets available on the Internet, while also reducing data access and updating delays for collaborative GVA environments. Both improve interactivity and flexibility from an end-user perspective. The proposed framework relies on a REST-based web interface providing scalable and spatio-temporal read-write access to complex spatio-temporal datasets of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data. The clean separation of client and server at the HTTP web layer assures backward compatibility and better extensibility. We discuss the proposed framework and apply it on a prototype implementation employing world debt data. The excellent compression ratio of SVG as well as its fast delivery to end users are encourageing and suggest important steps have been made towards dynamic, highly interactive, and collaborative geovisual analytics environments.},

The integral part of the Smart Walkers is an autonomous agent which monitors the activity of the user, assesses his physical conditions, and detects potential risks of falls. In this paper, we study methods which enable the agent to recognize the user activity from the sensor measurements. The proposed methods use Conditional Random Fields with features based on discriminant rules. A special case are features which, in order to distinguish between two activities, compare the sensor measurements to thresholds learned by a linear classifier. Experiments with real user data show that the methods achieve a good accuracy; the best results are obtained using “smooth” thresholds based on sigmoid functions.},

We propose a new non-invasive approach to detect walking behavior based on the motion transfer by the user on the walker. Our method has two main steps; the first is to extract a gait feature vector by analyzing the three-axis accelerometer data in terms of magnitude, gait cycle and frequency. The second is to classify gait with the use of a decision tree of multilayer perceptrons. To assess the performance of our technique, we evaluated different sampling window lengths of 1, 3 an 5seconds and four different Neural Network architectures. The results revealed that the algorithm can distinguish walking behavior such as normal, slow and fast with an accuracy of about 86\%. This research study is part of a project aiming at providing a simple and non-invasive walking behavior detector for elderly who use rollators.},

The reachable workspace can be used to track an individuals’ ability to perform activities of daily living, such as feeding and grooming. There are few methods for quantifying upper limb performance, none of which are able to generate a reachable workspace volume from motion capture data. We introduce a method to estimate the reachable workspace volume for an individual by capturing their observed joint limits using a low cost depth camera. This method is then tested on seven individuals with varying upper limb performance. Based on these initial trials, we found that the reachable workspace volume decreased as muscular impairment increased. This shows the potential for this method to be used as a quantitative clinical assessment tool.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

This paper examines if neighbourhood environments are associated with physical activity, especially walking and cycling. It analyses 608 respondent survey data from Washington State in the US and Geographic Information System-derived measures of the neighbourhood environment. Respondents reported traffic volume to be the most significant barrier, and good lighting to be the most important facilitator of walking and cycling. Utilitarian destinations, such as grocery stores, restaurants, retail stores and convenience stores, were significant correlates of walking and moderate-intensity physical activities, while housing type, sports facility and transportation infrastructure were correlated with vigorous physical activities. Active people rated higher for their neighbourhood attributes including safety, visual quality, knowing neighbours, seeing many other people walking and cycling, and the availability of sports facilities, parks, and bike racks. Simple interventions such as street lighting, pavements/sidewalks, street trees, benches, bike lanes or trails, bike racks, and traffic-calming devices appeared to hold some promise in promoting physical activities in neighbourhoods. Long-term solutions should include strategies to enhance overall aesthetics, safety, accessibility, street connectivity, and social interactions among neighbours. Keywords:},

Prospective relations with environmental factors have been examined for vigorous activity, but not for the moderate-intensity activities that environmental and policy initiatives are being designed to influence. PURPOSE: To examine prospective associations of changes in perceptions of local environmental attributes with changes in neighborhood walking. METHODS: Baseline and 10-week follow-up telephone interviews with 512 adults (49\% men). RESULTS: Men who reported positive changes in aesthetics and convenience were twice as likely to increase their walking. Women who reported positive changes in convenience were more than twice as likely to have increased their walking. There were contrasting findings for men and women who reported traffic as less of a problem: Men were 61\% less likely to have increased walking; however, women were 76\% more likely to have done so. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to determine the possibly causal nature of such environment-behavior relations and to elucidate relevant gender differences. Such evidence will provide underpinnings for public health initiatives to increase participation in physical activity.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a survey of pedestrian trips to transit that examined the trip lengths and route choices made by people walking to five rail transit stations in California and Oregon. In highly motorized countries such as the US, policy-makers are beginning to recognize that shifting some travel from auto trips to walking trips can help the country achieve important policy objectives such as combating obesity and reducing the air pollution and oil dependency that result from auto use. However, researchers know very little about pedestrian behaviour and the role of the built and aesthetic environment in influencing pedestrian trips to transit. As communities wrestle with the interconnected issues of obesity, sprawl, and quality of life, planners need to understand how far Americans will walk to transit and the environmental factors that influence them. This survey of 328 pedestrians walking to rail stations, primarily on weekday mornings, found that they were willing to walk an average of half a mile to the rail station and that minimizing the distance walked was the most important factor influencing their choice of route. The people surveyed also frequently mentioned safety factors as important in route choice. Aesthetic elements of the built environment, on the other hand, were rarely mentioned as important route choice factors. The paper concludes by using these survey findings to recommend strategies that planners, designers, and policy-makers can use to design successful transit and pedestrian-oriented developments.},

abstract = {his paper presents the results of a research project conducted in the UK designed to increase understanding of the factors which influence levels of walking and pedestrian route choice. It describes a number of techniques that were used to assess the pedestrian environment from a pedestrian’s perspective. These techniques included a computer based tool developed using stated preference surveys to determine the relative values of a range of factors in the pedestrian environment; an on-street survey that was designed to investigate values and attitudes towards different attributes of the pedestrian environment along a route; and finally an ‘on the move survey’ where pedestrian volunteers were interviewed while walking along the route in order to get an actual account of their experiences as they walk. A case study is then used to show the benefits and disadvantages of using these different techniques and compares the results of the three techniques along a pedestrian route in the City of Leeds in the UK. The results of this comparison show that there were a number of pedestrian attributes considered important by pedestrians when walking including pavement cleanliness, safe crossing places, and good connectivity. These aspects were highlighted in different ways through the three techniques. The computer based tool allowed different routes to be compared using the same criteria and provided a we ighting for each of the important pedestrian factors and an overall score for the route. The technique did not pick up on the route specific factors that were affecting pedestrians as they walked. The on-street survey allowed a larger range of pedestrian factor s to be considered using a 5 point scale from very good to very bad, which meant that certain factors which were not included in the tool were highlighted as being par ticular problems along specific routes. The final technique involved interviewing pedestrians as they walked along the route with specific questions asked as they crossed junctions and walked along links. This allowed a much greater exploration of the factors that affect how a pedestrian feels as they interact with the built environment and traffic},

abstract = {Preferences and behaviour of older pedestrians and cyclists (women and men, 70 years and above) in cities were studied by means of a questionnaire, and was compared to a group of people aged 40-49. The older respondents appreciate pedestrian crossings, signalized intersections and cycle paths significantly more than the younger respondents do. To a larger extent they feel that it is dangerous to cross the road where these facilities are missing. The older pedestrians also find the presence of a pavement very important on their route, whereas the younger pedestrians more often focus on a fast passage. Differences in preferences and behaviour within the group of older respondents can be related to differences in health and physical abilities rather than to differences in age and gender. The older road users seem to be more influenced by the fact that an action is illegal than the younger road users are. In several instances they more often give this reason for refraining from an act than the younger respondents. They also more often use the argument that they act in a specific way, because it makes them feel safer. And finally they more often express doubts about their own abilities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The GPS maps were used as prompts during the interviews. Open coding of the 35 interviews using latent content analysis resulted in key themes and subthemes that achieved consensus between coders. Two investigators independently coded the text of each interview.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Participants were on average of 67 years of age (range: 50-86) and predominantly used canes (57\%), walkers (57\%), or wheelchairs (46\%). Key themes pertained to curb ramp availability and condition, sidewalk availability and condition, hills, aesthetics, lighting, ramp availability, weather, presence and features of crosswalks, availability of resting places and shelter on streets, paved or smooth walking paths, safety, and traffic on roads.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPLICATIONS: A variety of built environment barriers and facilitators to neighborhood-based activity exist for midlife and older adults with mobility disabilities. Preparing our neighborhood environments for an aging population that uses assistive devices will be important to foster independence and health.},

abstract = {Purpose of the Study: The effects of the physical–spatial–technical environment on aging well have been overlooked both conceptually and empirically. In the spirit of M. Powell Lawton’s seminal work on aging and environment, this article attempts to rectify this situation by suggesting a new model of how older people interact with their environment. Design and Methods: Goals of the paper include (a) integration of the essential elements of the ecology and aging literature, particularly in regard to Lawton’s research, (b) development of connections between traditional theories of ecology of aging and life span developmental models of aging well, (c) acknowledgment of the pronounced historical and cohort-related changes affecting the interactions of older people with their environment, and (d) discussion of the implications of this analysis for concepts and theories of aging well. Results: The model builds on a pair of concepts: environment as related to agency and belonging, founded in motivational psychology, and developmental science. Implications: After describing the model’s key components, we discuss its heuristic potential in four propositions for future gerontological research and identify implications of the model for future empirical research.

abstract = {Ageing is driving the demand for housing for seniors in the Netherlands. The current urban planning 'cluster policy' is mainly conducive to the construction of luxury inner-city apartments for seniors. Much less attention is given to the demand for dwellings for seniors outside the cities and for low- and middle-income households. Should the government accommodate this demand by constructing accessible dwellings? And would a 'senior city' be a suitable framework for this purpose? The issue is whether senior citizens actually want to live together in a district, village or city. Would they want to move there if these senior cities were some distance away from other (age) groups, family, friends and services such as shops and care? We question whether the demand for senior cities is sufficiently strong to warrant abandoning the European planning principle of clustering. Doing so would lead to fragmentation of the landscape and less support for services in urbanized areas. The impetus for this study came from the major shortage of accessible housing in the Netherlands and a recent initiative to build a senior city of 1,500 dwellings in the province of Flevoland.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Increasing attention is being paid to the importance of built environment characteristics for participa-tion, especially among people with various levels of impairment or activity limitations. The purpose of this research was to examine the role of specific characteristics in the urban environment as they interact with underlying impairments and activity limitations to either promote or hinder participation in life situations. Using data from the Chicago Community Adult Health Study (2001e2003) in the United States, we used logistic regression to examine the effect of built environment characteristics on three indicators of participation (interpersonal interaction, obtaining preventive health care, and voting) among adults age 45þ (N ¼ 1225). We examined effects across two levels of spatial scale: the census tract and block group. One in five adults reported difficulty walking 2e3 blocks unaided, but their odds of engaging in regular interpersonal interaction was 45\% higher when they lived in areas with higher residential security. For the thirty-six percent of adults who reported visual impairment, and the odds of obtaining preventive health care were over 20\% lower when living in an area with heavy traffic. Residing in an area with a high proportion of streets in poor condition was associated with 60\% lower odds of voting among those with underlying difficulty with mobility activities. Results varied across levels of spatial scale. Simple changes in urban built environments may facilitate the full participation of all persons in society.},

abstract = {Volgens de nieuwe bevolkingsprognose van het CBS groeit de Nederlandse bevolking nog door tot 18 miljoen inwoners rond 2044, waarna de groei sterk vertraagt. Internationale migratie speelt een belangrijke rol bij de toekomstige bevolkingsgroei. Nederland telt in de toekomst meer ouderen en allochtonen. Ten opzichte van de bevolkingsprognose uit 2012 zijn de veronderstellingen voor het kindertal en de levensduur vrijwel ongewijzigd. Wel worden er meer immigranten en meer emigranten verwacht. De verwachte bevolkingsomvang in 2060 is 0,16 miljoen groter dan volgens de prognose uit 2012. Dat verschil zit geheel bij de inwoners jonger dan 65 jaar. Net als in de prognose uit 2012 wordt voorzien dat de AOW-leeftijd verder stijgt tot 71,5 jaar in 2060. 1. Inleiding De bevolkingsprognose van het CBS beschrijft de verwachte ontwikkeling van de Nederlandse bevolking tot 2060, waarbij de inwoners worden onderscheiden naar leeftijd, geslacht en herkomstgroep. Ook geeft de prognose informatie over geboorte, sterfte en internationale migratie. In deze nieuwe bevolkingsprognose zijn de recente ontwikkelingen op het gebied van kindertal, levensduur en migratie verwerkt. In het licht van deze ontwikkelingen zijn ook de in de vorige prognose (2012–2060) gebruikte langetermijnveronderstellingen opnieuw beoordeeld. Op het gebied van kindertal en levensduur heeft dat niet tot aanpassingen geleid, op het gebied van internationale migratie wel. Dit artikel beschrijft de uitkomsten van de bevolkingsprognose 2014–2060. Paragraaf 2 geeft een kort overzicht van de voorziene veranderingen in de omvang en samenstelling van de bevolking aan de hand van drie steekjaren (2015, 2040 en 2060). In paragraaf 3 worden de onderliggende veronderstellingen van de prognose toegelicht: Hoeveel kinderen krijgen vrouwen? Hoe oud worden we? Hoeveel migranten komen naar Nederland en welk deel blijft? De verschillen met de prognose uit 2012 worden besproken. Paragraaf 4 beschrijft de verwachte ontwikkeling van de bevolkingsstromen: geboorte, sterfte en migratie. Paragraaf 5 gaat dieper in op de veranderende leeftijdssamenstelling van de bevolking. In paragraaf 6 komt de toekomstige ontwikkeling van de AOW-leeftijd aan de orde, en welke consequenties die heeft voor het aantal inwoners in de werkzame leeftijden en het aantal AOW-gerechtigden.},

We evaluated the validity of Walk Score ® for assessing neighborhood walkability based on GIS (objective) indicators of neighborhood walkability with addresses from four US metropolitan areas with several street network buffer distances (i.e., 400-, 800-, and 1,600-meters). Address data come from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5–11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programs located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the US (n = 733). GIS data were used to measure multiple objective indicators of neighborhood walkability. Walk Scores were also obtained for the participant's residential addresses. Spearman correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators were calculated as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. There were many significant moderate correlations OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2011, 8 4161 between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators such as density of retail destinations and intersection density (p < 0.05). The magnitude varied by the GIS indicator of neighborhood walkability. Correlations generally became stronger with a larger spatial scale, and there were some geographic differences. Walk Score ® is free and publicly available for public health researchers and practitioners. Results from our study suggest that Walk Score ® is a valid measure of estimating certain aspects of neighborhood walkability, particularly at the 1600-meter buffer. As such, our study confirms and extends the generalizability of previous findings demonstrating that Walk Score is a valid measure of estimating neighborhood walkability in multiple geographic locations and at multiple spatial scales.},

It is based on a review of the literature, and the initial analyses of the first stage of a study designed to identify individual's views of the quality of their lives and to test the relevance of various scales used to measure quality of life. The study focuses on older people living at home in two contrasting areas of south east England, and demonstrates not only that older people can talk about, and do think about, quality of life, but also highlights how quality of life varies for different age groups of the elderly population living at home, in different geographical areas. In addition, early conclusions also indicate that there is more to quality of life than health: indeed, social contacts appear to be as valued components of a good quality of life as health status. This study deals with issues high on the agenda of the current debate on quality of life and its measurement; it has implications for those involved in both quality of life research and in health and social service policy for older people.},

De extramuralisering en het toenemende aantal ouderen vragen o.a. om wijken waarin mensen met een beperking zelfstandig kunnen blijven wonen. Wijken waarin bewoners zorg en begrip voor hun medemensen hebben. Wijken die sociaal en fysiek toegankelijk zijn voor iedereen. Als ik naar de wijken en buurten in Amsterdam kijk denk ik dat er nog veel te winnen valt voor mensen met een beperking en dat er weinig wijken zijn die aan de boven gestelde eisen voldoen. Ik werk als procesbegeleider voor bewonersgroepen in verschillende vernieuwingswijken in Amsterdam en hou mij vooral bezig met de fysieke kant. Ik zie dat het nog niet vanzelfsprekend is dat professionals van de overheid, projectontwikkelaars, ontwerpers en belangenorganisaties rond wonen ervan doordrongen zijn dat we toe moeten werken naar wijken voor iedereen. De wettelijke regelingen en verordeningen rond toegankelijkheid zijn vaak de enige eisen die toegepast worden en we weten dat deze lang niet voldoende zijn. Kortom ik denk dat we als professionals en medemensen verplicht zijn de komende jaren veel aandacht aan de ontwikkeling van wijken voor iedereen te geven. Door het uitvoeren van dit onderzoek ben ikzelf ervan doordrongen geraakt mij in mijn dagelijks werk in te zetten voor wijken voor iedereen. Ik kan mij dankzij het onderzoek verplaatsen in het perspectief van mensen met een beperking en probeer in mijn dagelijkse werk hiermee rekening te houden. Ook zal ik meer attent zijn op mijn gedrag in de openbare ruimte door bijvoorbeeld erover nadenken waar ik mijn fiets parkeer \ldots Ik hoop dat dit rapport een bijdrage kan leveren aan de discussie over het belang van wijken voor iedereen en dat hierdoor nog meer mensen doordrongen raken van het belang van wijken voor iedereen.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t In countries with winter weather characterised by low temperatures, snowfall and icy roads and pave-ments, getting out of the home to carry out everyday activities can be a challenge for many older people in cities and beyond. Inadequate clearance of snow and poor gritting of pavements prevent people with even slightly reduced motion capacity from going outdoors, while those who use a walking-stick or a roll-ing walker are even more vulnerable to the weather. How much does winter weather impact on the activ-ity levels of older people, and what activities are affected? The empirical analysis in this paper is based on results from focus groups of participants carried out in five different communities in Norway and on data from the Norwegian National Travel Survey (NTS) of 2005. The study is concentrated on the daily activ-ities of the groups, especially out-of-home activities, i.e. what these older people do, where their activities take place, with whom they interact, the types of transport mode they use, and the barriers they meet. Winter conditions are mentioned by all groups as one of the barriers they have to contend with. The NTS includes data on transport mode, travel purpose, distance, time-use, date for the interview and socio-demographic data. The results point to lower activity \`{A} measured in number of trips taken and kilometres travelled in winter (November–March) compared to summer (April–October) among the older groups. The oldest use the car less in the winter than in the summer, and have fewer trips to the shops and to friends and relatives.},

In order to explore differences according to functional limitations (FL) among very old people with respect to frequency of activity, perceived health, overall perception of neighbourhood environment, and perceived problems in the pedestrian environment, data derived from a postal questionnaire survey to very old people living in an urban area in Sweden were used. This explorative study is based on the sub-sample of people aged 80+ who reported outdoor activities (n = 97). Four groups of respondents with different types of FL were identified: with no FL (n = 23), with only move-ment-related FL (n = 26), with only perception/cognition-related FL (n = 16), and with both movement-and per-ception/ cognition-related FL (n = 32). The majority of the respondents reported rather high frequency of activity out-side home. When examining differences between the four groups, the analysis indicated how the complexity of FL and perceived problems in the pedestrian environment impacted on their activity performance. Persons with both movement-and perception/cognition-related FL were less satisfied with their frequency of activity, experienced their health more negatively and experienced more problems in the pedestrian environment than in the other groups. The findings from this study indicate the importance of considering combinations of FL in creating supportive environments for activity and health.},

Data of 1634 people aged 55 years and older were available for analyses (response 64\%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine possible associations between expressed information needs and variables on demographics, lifestyle risk behaviours, physical and psychosocial health. Results: Several significant associations were found between information needs and corre-sponding health and lifestyle problems. However, the explanatory power of the observed problems was generally low, explaining only 7\% of the informational needs on lifestyle, and 17\% and 28\% of the informational needs on physical and psychosocial health, respectively. Conclusions: The findings suggest that prevention amongst the elderly should not be solely based on information needs, but also on observed lifestyle and health. Implications for the use of different approaches of prevention and behavioural models underlying interventions are discussed.},

abstract = {Travel encompasses a much wider environment than a journey by a person in a vehicle, thus actual travel takes place within the 'travel environment'. Travel is very complex but it can be subdivided into three broad components: the person; the vehicle; and the built environment. Travel can only be carried out if the three components are linked by means of a 'travel chain' and a journey cannot be made effectively if all the links are not efficiently joined. For many mobility-impaired people the 'travel chain' is negated by 'built environment barriers'. Travel is interdisciplinary and only an interdisciplinary approach can reduce barriers and increase mobility. Thus this paper is interdisciplinary in its approach to a major transport problem -the 'unfriendly street'. Accessible buses are starting to come into operation in the United Kingdom and expectations are high that the travel of older people will increase because of these buses. The authors use recent research to challenge this belief and argue that there will be little increase in travel by older people owing to present low patronage and built environment barriers. The authors then identify major barriers to travel which make streets very unfriendly and itemize 18 barriers to access which can be removed by good design. Design parameters are presented to overcome the major problem of unfriendly surfaces in paved areas and the paper concludes by reiterating that travel for older people can only be increased by an interdiscipline approach which links 'friendly buses' with 'friendly streets'.},

Implications for transportation planning include redefining how networks are conceived to include not just road and bus networks, but also the spatio-temporal networks constructed by low-income people as they organize their activities.-tion Research Board 2005). For women who do not have access to a private vehicle, there are the added constraints of using public transportation; which often entails limited routes, inconvenient transfers, long travel times, and safety issues. These constraints are even more pronounced in low-income households, which tend to make fewer trips and travel shorter distances (Bingham and Zhang 1997; Lucas 2004). This lack of access to adequate mobility has led some researchers to explore the relationship between transport and social exclusion (Keyton et al.},

MENSenSTRAAT stelt dat ook de woonomgeving een doorslaggevende rol speelt in het welslagen van deze missie. Zolang ouderen zelfstandig de deur uit kunnen en durven, kunnen zij voldoende bewegen, zelf hun boodschappen doen en hun sociale contacten onderhouden en daarmee de regie houden over hun leven. Om dit mogelijk te maken, moet de woonomgeving worden aangepast aan de kleine actieradius en de kwetsbaarheid van ouderen.

Walking is learned during the first year of life and reaches maturity around 7 until 60 years. Elderly walking performance then starts to decline and the elderly slow down gradually. Falls are a major cause of morbidity in the elderly and in almost all incidences of falls, some aspects of locomotion have been implicated. With the increased life expectancy of the elderly and their more active lifestyle there is now an emphasis on determining any changes that occur in their gait patterns in order to reduce the frequency of falls, to identify diagnostic measures that are reliable predictors of fall-prone elderly and finally to develop programs for preventing such falls. This review addresses the gait related changes in the elderly in order to pinpoint the effect of normal aging for comparison with different gait deviations related to some pathologies. Spatio-temporal, kinematics, kinetics and EMG data will be reviewed as well as the physiological changes associated with gait and aging. Finally, the selection criteria will be reviewed and recommendation on the urgent need of a valid healthy elderly database will be addressed. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

This would be a new departure for the measurement of social exclusion, which so far has relied either on aggregate measures of locations or cross-sectional data of individuals. The size of a person's activity space can only be estimated with information reflecting a longer time horizon. In this paper the six-week travel diary survey (Mobidrive) is used, which was conducted in two German cities in 1999. About 95\% of all local trips were coded for 300 respondents (about 45,000 trips). The paper develops three possible measurement approaches of increasing complexity (confidence ellipse, kernel density estimates, shortest paths networks). The analysis revealed that the main driver of the size of the activity spaces is the overall number of unique locations visited by the respondents and to a lesser extent, their socio-demographic characteristics. In particular, the groups most often consider to be at risk of social exclusion (female, lower income, elderly) did not show significantly different activity spaces.},

We describe the construction and application of the SDE at one and two standard deviations, and three additional network-based measures of activity space using common tools in GIS: the road network buffer (RNB), the 30-minute standard travel time polygon (STT), and the relative travel time polygon (RTT). We compare the theoretical and methodological assumptions of each measure, and evaluate the measures by examining access to primary care services, using data from western North Carolina. Results: Individual accessibility is defined as the availability of healthcare opportunities within that individual's activity space. Access is influenced by the shape and area of an individual's activity space, the spatial distribution of opportunities, and by the spatial structures that constrain and direct movement through space; the shape and area of the activity space is partly a product of how it is conceptualized and measured. Network-derived measures improve upon the SDE by incorporating the spatial structures (roads) that channel movement. The area of the STT is primarily influenced by the location of a respondent's residence within the road network hierarchy, with residents living near primary roads having the largest activity spaces. The RNB was most descriptive of actual opportunities and can be used to examine bypassing. The area of the RTT had the strongest correlation with a healthcare destination being located inside the activity space. Conclusion: The availability of geospatial technologies and data create multiple options for representing and operationalizing the construct of activity space. Each approach has its strengths and limitations, and presents a different view of accessibility. While the choice of method ultimately lies in the research question, interpretation of results must consider the interrelated issues of method, representation, and application. Triangulation aids this interpretation and provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of accessibility.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t An increased focus on international and national levels of society to meet the transportation needs of older people and people with disabilities is realized through legislation, directives and guidelines on accessibility. This paper examines effects of removing physical barriers according to current Swedish governmental accessibility directives on older peoples' perceptions of outdoor environments (usability) and on their mobility and perceived safety as pedestrians. This paper also focuses on municipal planners' views on the implementation of improved accessibility. A before–after study, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, is conducted. The results from the questionnaires show that older peoples' overall satisfaction with the outdoor environment has increased after implementation; however no differences are found if physical barriers specifically are considered. Older peoples' mobility is also unchanged; nevertheless, fewer respondents are stating difficulties in walking due to barriers in the outdoor environments as reason to avoid outdoor mobility. Problems do remain after implementation, for example concerning safety/security-related issues and inaccessible entrances and indoor environments.},

abstract = {De Werkgroep Wageningen Toegankelijk is in de zomer van 2012 ontstaan, doordat verschillende initiatieven bij elkaar kwamen: • Uit Wmo-besprekingen bleek dat er bij de gemeente 20.000 euro gereserveerd was voor een nieuw onderzoek naar de toegankelijkheid van Wageningen voor gehandicapten, terwijl er een onderzoek ligt uit 2004 waar eigenlijk niets mee gedaan is. Het Wmo-platform was van mening dat actualiseren en aanpakken van problemen meer effect zou hebben. • Tegelijkertijd bestond in de Wageningse politiek de wens om de toegankelijkheid van Wageningen in een breed maatschappelijk platform te agenderen. Beide initiatieven vonden elkaar in de Werkgroep Wageningen Toegankelijk. De Werkgroep kent een variabele bezetting. In oktober 2012 bestond hij uit Monique Lenselink (stagemakelaar MaS), Greet van Erp (diaconaal Wmo-platform), Masood Eslami (ChipShop), Hettie van Nes (GroenLinks Wageningen), Dedde de Jong, Carla Aalsma (Solidez), Barbara Finkensieper, (Solidez/De Wielewaag), Anja Wouters (MEE Veluwe) Marij Barends en Jan Willem van Dijk (Rode Kruis Renkum-Wageningen). De Werkgroep stelt zich tot doel de problemen in de toegankelijkheid van Wageningen voor minder validen breed onder de aandacht te brengen en draagvlak te cre\"{e}ren om verbeteringen in de toegankelijkheid aan te brengen.},

abstract = {The aim of the present Country Report is to present a comprehensive and true generic picture of the pedestrian's functioning and satisfaction with offered conditions. In order to provide a true picture of reality, hidden issues must be uncovered, and figures be corrected for bias, by complementary estimations. Furthermore, reality must be evaluated from all relevant perspectives: functionality, perception, durability and future prospects, and coherence and integration. A decisive factor in pedestrian performance and satisfaction is the pedestrian's ability to cope with his environment. Pedestrians are an extremely heterogeneous group. The functioning of the system depends particularly on how well low competency persons can function. The order of magnitude of mobility restrictions can be estimated through much used indicators from the SF12 surveys and OECD indicators for Quality of Life studies. Additional indicators can be derived from travel surveys and health statistics on disorders. About 50\% of the pedestrians have limited abilities and about 10\% of the population has severe difficulties walking and sojourning in public space (see tables 2 – 12) Mobility is defined by the freedom to choose to travel and sojourn in public space. The amount of distance that one can cover is less important than being able to make a trip. Pedestrian mobility differs from other modes by that it is part of almost all other trips. Multi-modal walking is (almost) as extensive as walking from door to door, but this is hidden in statistics. However, the hidden amount of walking can be estimated within reasonable margins.},

abstract = {A limited number of studies look at older people's use of space outside the 'home' environment, particularly unfamiliar, public urban space. Such unfamiliarity can be created through older people travelling as tourists to new areas; as a consequence of urban regeneration; or as a result of cognitive decline, where the familiar becomes unfamiliar. This paper explores the experiences of older people as pedestrians in unfamiliar urban spaces. In looks at two aspects: older people's spatial anxieties and the barriers (physical, psychological, spatial and social) they perceive and encounter in unfamiliar surroundings. Forty-four participants who took part in a reality cave exercise and a sub group of 10 people who visited an unfamiliar area as pedestrians describe their experience of walking a predetermined route. Given increasing urbanisation and population ageing this is an area of importance to geographers and gerontologists.Our study showed that there are a number of barriers that are a concern for older people in new environments; these include poor signage, confusing spaces, poor paving and 'sensory overload' i.e. noise and complexity of the environment. Landmarks and distinctive buildings were more important to participants than signage in navigating unfamiliar areas. Such experiences can contribute to practice implications for planners in designing neighbourhoods to support older people. Small changes such as placing distance on clearly marked signage; giving further information about particular areas beyond the key tourist points and using landmarks as clear navigational aids are important. This paper also adds to the growing literature on geographical gerontology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, the development of the audit methodology is presented, including the design of the instrument, the creation of training and supporting materials, administration, and integration with handheld technology. Various tests of inter- and intra-rater reliability of our instrument have been conducted, including individual audit measures and various approaches to administering the audit. The results indicate high reliability for most measures and confirmed administration procedures.

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a research project conducted in the UK designed to increase understanding of the factors which influence levels of walking and pedestrian route choice. It describes a number of techniques that were used to assess the pedestrian environment from a pedestrian's perspective. These techniques included a computer based tool developed using stated preference surveys to determine the relative values of a range of factors in the pedestrian environment; an on-street survey that was designed to investigate values and attitudes towards different attributes of the pedestrian environment along a route; and finally an 'on the move survey' where pedestrian volunteers were interviewed while walking along the route in order to get an actual account of their experiences as they walk. A case study is then used to show the benefits and disadvantages of using these different techniques and compares results for a pedestrian route in the City of Leeds in the UK. The results indicate that there were a number of pedestrian attributes considered important by pedestrians when walking including pavement cleanliness, safe crossing places, good connectivity and sense of security. The three approaches complement one another and have highlighted in different ways that the walking experience is affected by the cumulative impact of multiple interactions (both positive and negative) as people walk in the pedestrian environment. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
